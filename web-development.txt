Introduction
Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that are accessible through the internet or a private network. It combines creative design, technical programming, and strategic planning to create digital experiences that are functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing. As businesses, governments, and individuals increasingly rely on online platforms, web development has become an essential skill and a rapidly evolving field.

Front-End Development
This focuses on the parts of a website that users interact with directly. Using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers build layouts, design interfaces, and ensure responsive behavior across devices.



Back-End Development
The back end is responsible for the server, database, and application logic. Developers use languages such as Python, PHP, Java, or Node.js to manage data, authentication, and overall functionality behind the scenes.



database
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily stored, accessed, and managed, often using tables, so multiple users or applications can retrieve and update information efficiently.
